# 8 bit multiplier using lookup tables
This project demonstrates designing of an 8-by-8 bit multiplier for ALUs, step by step. However, instead of using [Wallace tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_tree) or [Dadda multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadda_multiplier), it utilizes a small ROM. Therefore, it calculates the results with less clock cycles, but at the cost of occupying more space in the die area. The models are developed in both [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog).
