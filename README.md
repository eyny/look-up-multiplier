# 8 bit multiplier using lookup tables
This project demonstrates designing of a basic 8-by-8 bit lookup multiplier step by step. The models are developed in both [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) and [Verilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog).

The detailed guide will be included in repository later.
